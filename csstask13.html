        <div class="c">Uppalapati Venkata Suryanarayana Prabhas Raju, known mononymously as Prabhas, is an Indian actor
            who
            predominantly works in Telugu cinema. He is one of the highest-paid actors in Indian cinema and has been
            featured in Forbes India's Celebrity 100 list since 2015 Prabhas made his acting debut with the drama Eeswar
            (2002), and later attained his breakthrough with the action romance Varsham (2004). He went on to star in
            other commercially successful films such as Chatrapathi (2005), Bujjigadu (2008), Billa (2009), Darling
            (2010), Mr. Perfect (2011), and Mirchi (2013), winning the Nandi Award for Best Actor for his performance in
            the lattermost.[12][13] He went on to play a dual role in the epic action duology Baahubali: The Beginning
            (2015) and Baahubali 2: The Conclusion (2017), with the latter emerging as the highest-grossing Indian film
            at that point, establishing Prabhas as the first pan-Indian star.[14][15] After a brief period of decline,
            he made a career comeback with the action drama Salaar: Part 1 â€“ Ceasefire (2023) and the science fiction
            film Kalki 2898 AD (2024).[16]</div>
